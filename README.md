# UIX by yerTools (currently in development)

**`At the moment there is little to no documentation for this project because it isn't in Alpha/Beta stage yet.`**

Hello world and welcome to a new project of mine.

I'm developing a **C**ontent-**M**anagement-**S**ystem with the feature, that it should be able to perform `serverless`.
Ok, you stil need a server to serve your content but everything user specified is stored in a single json file, so no PHP, ASP.NET, Node.js, etc. is required.  
If you have a backend that can support server-side scripts *(UIX should be able to perform on multiple platforms)*, the server will do the page rendering.
So search engines, web crawler and even noscript users are able to read your page.
But if the client supports javascript, the page rendering is performed on the client side.

`Web Workers` *(if available)* will perform most of the operations, so the main thread should always be responsive.
Because to this multithreading approach, the available resources on the client devices are getting utilized for the best performance.

A `Service Worker` *(if available)* will store the main parts of this sytem offline, on the client device.
This will result in short to no loading times and site navigations should happen nearly instantly.

`Web Assembly` *(if available)* will be used to realize the HTML rendering engine. With it, it can leverage the most out of modern browsers and at the same time its code can also run outside the web. For example can the ASP.NET 'version' of this project use the same code for the server-side rendering of HTML.

At the end UIX should be an easy to use CMS with a focus on blazing fast performance. It should be platform independent and run on nearly every end user device.
