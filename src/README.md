# UIX by yerTools (currently in development)

Welcome to the `src` directory! This is the place where the magic happens! :)

---

Currently this application consists of three types:
- [`Scss`](/src/Scss/) - This is for the style of this application. It's like CSS but with some additional features.
- [`TypeScript`](/src/TypeScript/) - The main part is written in this language. It's like JavaScript but with types and a strict syntax.
- [`Utilities`](/src/Utilities/) - Here are some tools that should improve the experience while developing.
    - [`Buildtools`](/src/Utilities/Buildtools/) - This is a little helper for compiling and building UIX. It's written in .NET Core so you should be able to run it on 'every' operating system.

**`At the moment there is little to no documentation for this project because it isn't in Alpha/Beta stage yet.`**

If you want to try it anyways, there are some [additional informations](/src/Utilities/README.md) in the [`src/Utilities`](/src/Utilities/) directory.
